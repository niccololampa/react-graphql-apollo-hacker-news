import { setContext } from 'apollo-link-context';
import { AUTH_TOKEN } from './constants';

// Here you create the httpLink that will connect your ApolloClient instance with the GraphQL API, your GraphQL server will be running on http://localhost:4000.

const httpLink = createHttpLink({
  uri: 'http://localhost:4000'
});

// for security
//This middleware will be invoked every time ApolloClient sends a request to the server. Apollo Links allow you to create middlewares that let you modify requests before they are sent to the server.
// how it works in our code: first, we get the authentication token from localStorage if it exists; after that, we return the headers to the context so httpLink can read them.
const authLink = setContext((_, { headers }) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem(AUTH_TOKEN);
  return {

// Finally you render the root component of your React app.
// The App is wrapped with the higher - order component ApolloProvider that gets passed the client as a prop.
